## Sprintweek 
Sprint Week 1: Thought process. I spent time thinking how my app should operate. I spent time designing how my app will look and how each screen will look

Sprint Week 2: After thinking on what to do I will start by designing the start up screen. 

Sprint Week 3: After the startup page is done I will start working on the rest of the screens.

Sprint week 4: make sure there are no bugs. Test everything and make sure the app works perfectly.
